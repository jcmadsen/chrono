chrono-parallel
==============
The following libraries are required to compile Chrono::Parallel:
* Chrono https://github.com/projectchrono/chrono
* Blaze https://code.google.com/p/blaze-lib/
* GLM http://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.6/index.html
* GLFW http://www.glfw.org/
* GLEW http://glew.sourceforge.net/

------------
## Building on Windows+MSVC
(Note: these are for 64-bit windows builds, using MSVC 2010.)

First, download the following external dependencies for OpenGL and some math:

1. GLEW: OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library (binaries are acceptable)
2. GLM: OpenGL Mathematics (only headers)
3. GLFW: multi-platform OpenGL library for creating windows and inputs/events (need to compile this one)

Second, Build the GLFW libraries by using the included CMake files. 
(Optional) enable `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` when generating your project with CMake.

Third, set-up the chrono-parallel CMake file with the following configuration settings:

1. `ENABLE_OPENGL`, `ENABLE_TESTS`, `ENABLE_UTILS` boxes should all be checked
2. `CHRONO_INC` should be set to `.../Chrono/src`
3. `CHRONO_LIB_PATH` should be set to `.../Chrono-Build/lib`
4. `GLEW_INCLUDE_DIR` set to `.../glew-1.10.0/include`
5. `GLEW_LIBRARY` set to `.../glew-1.10.0/lib/Release/x64/glew32.lib`
6. `GLFW_INCLUDE_DIR` set to `.../glfw-3.0.4/glfw-3.0.4/include/GLFW`
7. `GLFW_LIBRARY` set to `.../glfw-3.0.4/glfw-Build/src/Release/glfw3dll.lib`
8. `GLM_INCLUDE_DIR` set to `.../glm-0.9.5.3`

Configuring the CMake file should report that Chrono lib has been found and copied, as well as GLFW.

------------
## Running the demos

Copy the .dll file associated with GLEW and GLFW also need to be copied over.

Ensure you've pulled from the `radu-demos` branch. This will result in the CMake file having an additional `ENABLE_DEMOS` box you should check.

Copy over the openGL resource files from `.../chrono-parallel/chrono_utils/opengl/resources` to your build directory.

Manually create the folder where the output for your particular demo will be written to. E.g., for `test_ball`, create the folder `../TEST_BALL_DEM` or `../TEST_BALL_DVI`, depending on if you're using the DEM or DVI solver. (make the folder in the same directory as the Debug and Release folders).


------------
## Debugging inside of MSVC

In project properties, under `configuration settings --> Debugging`, change working directory from `${ProjectDir}` to `${OutDir}`.

Copy over `glew32.dll` and `glfw3.dll`. Also, copy over the Debug version of `ChronoEngine.dll`

------------
TODO: copy these over automatically: (*windows builds only have this problem)

- `glew32.dll`
- `glfw3.dll`

TODO: create output folders, for any created demos. (windows builds only) Depends on selection of DEM or DVI solver (should be specified in the CMake config process).

TODO: copy over the opengl resource files automatically.

TODO: copy over `../bin/Debug/ChronoEngine.dll` to the debug directory.
